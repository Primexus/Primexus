    <h1>Hey everyone, I'm Pierre Tran ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <h3>Software Engineering Student at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al</h3>

I've started coding two years ago with lots of improvement. I'm mostly experienced when it comes to good code practices, testing and interfaces. You can find some of my personal projects in this page. I'm also a Discord bot enjoyer, and I plan to deploy one eventually.

### Facts about me:
- I also speak French, I'm from MontrÃ©al after all! (No rhymes intended)
- Coding is not my only passion, I also love videogames as well as playing piano.
- Some may say I'm es-lint reincarnated, due to my excessive bashing on coding practices (OCD kicking in).
